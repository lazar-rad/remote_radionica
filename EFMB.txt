Come on, hop on, let's take a ride
Welcoming the shrew that survived
To see the tiktaalik take her first walk
Witness the birth of flight

Deeper down in Panthalassa
A eukaryote finds her way
We return to the very first one
Greet the one we'll soon become

Lay on a field of green
With Mother Eve
With Father pine reaching high
Look at youself in the eyes of aye-aye
Unfolding rendezvous

Deep into the past follow the aeon path
Greet a blade of grass
Every endless form most beautiful
