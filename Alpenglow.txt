Alpenglow (Nightwish 2015)

Once upon a time a song was heard
Giving birth to a child of earth and verse

Together we slay another fright
Every Jubjub bird, spooks of the past
Close your eyes and take a peek
The truth is easy to see

We were here
Roaming on the endless prairie
Writing an endless story
Building a Walden of our own
We were here
Grieving the saddened faces
Conquering the darkest places
Time to rest now and to finish the show
And become the Music, one with alpenglow
